				<h1>this is act 1</h1>
				<h2>scene 1</h2>
				<p>What the fuck did you say about my code, you little glitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in my self taught coding program. I've been involved in numerous secret patches to AAA games, and I have only 100 other bugs. I am trained in hacking warfare, and I'm the top coder in my apartment room. You are nothing to me but just another little bug. I will patch you the fuck up with precision the likes of which you have never seen, mark my fucking fixes. You think you can get away with reporting that problem to me in my own program? Think again, error. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Hackathon hackers across the state, and you are being patched again so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that patches the pathetic little thing called your severity. I can be anywhere, anytime and fix you in 1337 different ways and thats just without any soylent. Not only am I extensively trained in C++ coding, but I have access to the entire arsenal of "[coding language] for dummies" books. If only you would have known what issues a problematic line of code could have bought upon me, you would have held your freaking error. But you couldn't, you wouldn't and now your paying the price you broken variable. I will shit bools all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking fixed, buggo.</p>
